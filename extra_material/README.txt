| Dear Angel,
| 
| Please do make use these notes; they were developed with free distribution in
| mind. I'm afraid I have moved jobs several times since I wrote these note and no
| longer have access to the source material.
| 
| The notes are quite old now and you should make sure the examples work with more recent compilers.
| 
| Good luck.
