  | Dear Angel,
  | 
  | Please do make use these notes; they were developed with free distribution in
  | mind. I'm afraid I have moved jobs several times since I wrote these note and no
  | longer have access to the source material.
  | 
  | The notes are quite old now and you should make sure the examples work with more recent compilers.
  | 
  | Good luck.
