  \label{ex:rightsendrecv}
  Revisit exercise~\ref{ex:serialsend} and solve it using
  \indexmpishow{MPI_Sendrecv}.

  If you have TAU installed, make a trace. Does it look different
  from the serialized send/recv code? If you don't have TAU, run your
  code with different numbers of processes and show that the runtime
  is essentially constant.
