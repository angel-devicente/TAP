  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Let each process have an empty array of sufficient length and a
    stack pointer that maintains the first free location.
  \item
    Now let each process randomly put data in a free location of another
    process' array.
  \item Use window locking. (Why is active target synchronization not possible?)
  \end{itemize}
