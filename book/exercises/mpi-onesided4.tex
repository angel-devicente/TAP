  \label{ex:countdown}

  Implement a shared counter:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One process maintains a counter;
  \item Iterate: all others at random moments update this counter.
  \item When the counter is no longer positive, everyone stops iterating.
  \end{itemize}
  The problem here is data synchronization: does everyone see the
  counter the same way?
