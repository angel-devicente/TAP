  \label{ex:gaussjordancoll}
  The \indexterm{Gauss-Jordan algorithm} for solving a linear system
  with a matrix~$A$ (or computing its inverse) runs as follows:
  {\small
  \begin{tabbing}
    for \=pivot $k=1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>let the vector of scalings $\ell^{(k)}_i=A_{ik}/A_{kk}$\\
    \>for \=row $r\not=k$\\
    \>\>for \=column $c=1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>\>\> $A_{rc}\leftarrow A_{rc} - \ell^{(k)}_r A_{rc}$\\
  \end{tabbing}
  }
  where we ignore the update of the righthand side, or the formation
  of the inverse.

  Let a matrix be distributed with each process storing one
  column. Implement the Gauss-Jordan algorithm as a series of
  broadcasts: in iteration $k$ process $k$ computes and broadcasts the
  scaling vector~$\{\ell^{(k)}_i\}_i$. Replicate the right-hand side on
  all processors.
