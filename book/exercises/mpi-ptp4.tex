  \label{ex:inproduct}
  Implement an inner product routine: let $x$ be a
  distributed vector of size~$N$ with elements $x[i]=i$,
  and compute~$x^tx$.
  As before, the right value is $(2N^3+3N^2+N)/6$.

  Use the inner product value to scale to vector so that it has
  norm~1.
  Check that your computation is correct.
