  Let processor~0 have an array~$x$ of length $10P$, where $P$~is the number of processors.
  Elements $0,P,2P,\ldots,9P$ should go to processor zero, $1,P+1,2P+1,\ldots$ to processor~1,
  et cetera. Code this as a sequence of send/recv calls, using a vector datatype
  for the send, and a contiguous buffer for the receive.

  For simplicity, skip the send to/from zero. What is the most elegant
  solution if you want to include that case?

  For testing, define the array as $x[i]=i$.
