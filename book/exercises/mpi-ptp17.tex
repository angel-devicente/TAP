  \label{ex:3ptnonblock-hide}
  Take your code of exercise~\ref{ex:3ptnonblock} and modify it to use
  latency hiding. Operations that can be performed without needing
  data from neighbours should be performed in between the
  \lstinline{MPI_Isend}~/ \lstinline{MPI_Irecv} calls and the
  corresponding \lstinline{MPI_Wait} calls.
