  \label{ex:argv-bcast}
  If you give a commandline argument to a program, that argument is available
  as a character string as part of the \n{argv,argc} pair that you typically use
  as the arguments to your main program. You can use the function \n{atoi} to
  convert such a string to integer.

  Write a program where process~0 looks for an integer on the commandline, and
  broadcasts it to the other processes. Initialize the buffer on all processes, and
  let all processes print out the broadcast number,
  just to check that you solved the problem correctly.
