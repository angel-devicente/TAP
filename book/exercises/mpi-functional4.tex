  \label{ex:hello3}
  Write a program where each process prints out a message
  reporting its number, and how many processes there are:
\begin{verbatim}
Hello from process 2 out of 5!
\end{verbatim}

  Write a second version of this program, where each process opens a
  unique file and writes to it. \emph{On some clusters this may not be
    advisable if you have large numbers of processors, since it can
    overload the file system.}
