  \label{ex:cubegather}

  Assume that your number of processors is $P=Q^3$, and that each
  process has an array of identical size. Use
  \indexmpishow{MPI_Type_create_subarray} to gather all data onto a root process.
  Use a sequence of send and receive calls;
  \indexmpishow{MPI_Gather} does not work here.

\begin{tacc}
If you haven't started \n{idev} with the right number of processes,
use
\begin{verbatim}
ibrun -np 27 cubegather
\end{verbatim}
Normally you use \n{ibrun} without process count argument.
\end{tacc}
