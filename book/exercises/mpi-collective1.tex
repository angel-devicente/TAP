  \label{ex:collective-cases}
  How would you realize the following scenarios with MPI collectives?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let each process compute a random number. You want to print the
    maximum of these numbers to your screen.
  \item Each process computes a random number again. Now you want to
    scale these numbers by their maximum.
  \item Let each process compute a random number. You want to print on what processor the
    maximum value is computed.
  \end{itemize}
