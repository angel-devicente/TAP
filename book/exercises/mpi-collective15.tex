  Revisit exercise~\ref{ex:rowcolcomm}. Let only the first row and
  first column have certain data, which they broadcast through columns
  and rows respectively. Each process is now involved in two
  simultaneous collectives. Implement this with non-blocking
  broadcasts, and time the difference between a blocking and a
  non-blocking solution.
