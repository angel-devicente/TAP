  \label{ex:countdownop}
  Redo exercise~\ref{ex:countdown} using \indexmpishow{MPI_Fetch_and_op}. The
  problem is again to make sure all processes have the same view of
  the shared counter.

  Does it work to make the fetch-and-op conditional? Is there a way to
  do it unconditionally? What should the `break' test be, seeing that
  multiple processes can update the counter at the same time?
