  \label{ex:bucket-block}
  Take the code of exercise~\ref{ex:linear-sequential} and modify it
  so that the data from process zero gets propagated to every
  process. Specifically: compute
  \[
  \begin{cases}
    x_0 = 1&\hbox{on process zero}\\
    x_p = x_{p-1}+(p+1)^2 & \hbox{on process $p$}\\
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Use \indexmpishow{MPI_Send} and \indexmpishow{MPI_Recv}; make sure to get the order right.
