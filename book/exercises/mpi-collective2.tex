  \label{ex:randommaxscale}
  Let each process compute a random number,
  and compute the sum of these numbers using the \indexmpishow{MPI_Allreduce}
  routine.

  (The operator is \indexmpishow{MPI_SUM} for C/Fortran, or \indexmpishow{MPI.SUM} for
  Python.)

  Each process then scales its value
  by this sum. Compute the sum of the scaled numbers and check that it is~1.
