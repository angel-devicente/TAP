  \label{ex:pingpong}
  Implement the ping-pong program. Add a timer using \indexmpishow{MPI_Wtime}.
  For the \n{status} argument of the receive call, use
  \indexmpishow{MPI_STATUS_IGNORE}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Run multiple ping-pongs (say a thousand) and put the timer
    around the loop. The first run may take longer; try to discard it.
  \item Run your code with the two communicating processes first on
    the same node, then on different nodes. Do you see a difference?
  \item Then modify the program
    to use longer messages. How does the timing increase with message size?
  \end{itemize}
  For bonus points, can you do a regression to determine~$\alpha,\beta$?
