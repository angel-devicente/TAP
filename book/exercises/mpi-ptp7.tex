  (Classroom exercise) Each student holds a piece of paper
  in the right hand --~keep your left hand behind your back~--
  and we want to execute:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Give the paper to your right neighbour;
  \item Accept the paper from your left neighbour.
  \end{enumerate}
  Including boundary conditions for first and last process, that becomes
  the following program:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If you are not the rightmost student, turn to the right
    and give the paper to your right neighbour.
  \item If you are not the leftmost student, turn to your left and
    accept the paper from your left neighbour.
  \end{enumerate}
