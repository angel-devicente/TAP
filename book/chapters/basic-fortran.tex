\Level 0 {Basic Fortran}
\label{sec:basic-fortran}

In this chapter we will just cover the basic concepts of Fortran. Fortran is a
complex language, so in this chapter we will only cover the surface of the
language, only the necessary minimum to be able to write a first implementation
of the N-body problem.

The following slides are taken from a 5-day intentive course on Fortran, given by the
University of Liverpool.
