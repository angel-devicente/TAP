``The ``N-Body problem'' is the problem of trying to find how n objects will
move under one of the physical forces, such as gravity.'' (The introductory text
on the N-body Problem that comes with the source code to XStar
http://www.schlitt.net/xstar/)

The equations to solve the N-body problem are very simple. See, for example,
sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the Xstar guide
(http://www.schlitt.net/xstar/n-body/nb-8.html), and page 65 of ``Moving Stars
Around''.

To integrate in time, one can use several methods. The simplest one, of order 1
is Forward-Euler, as can be seen in page 24 of ``Moving Stars
Around''. The one we are going to use here is of order 2: the leapfrom algorithm
(see pages 55-56 of ``Moving Stars Around'').
